User contacts auth server
Auth server contacts identity provider, for now Surf Conext
It sends a SAML (XML) file to the user
The user presents the SAML file to the auth server
The auth server replies with an Oauth token
The user presents the Oauth token to the key server
The key server replies with the Client keys file (I think it's the JSON file)
The user presents some information therein contained to the access manager. The access manager talks with the transcriptor and gives back to the user a ticket
With the ticket, the user can get the data from the storage facility and use one of the keys of the Client keys file to decrypt it.
