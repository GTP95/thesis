First idea to get users' data from PP was to use IRMA to disclose the data needed to compute the pseudonym to some component that would then proceed to generate it. Doesn't work because the pseudonym is generated by encrypting a 
random string. But that random seed gets also stored inside salesforce, maybe I can get it from there? To answer I need to know:
1. Is the seed stored along som data that uniquely identifies the user?
2. Does salesforce have some API to inteface with other software?
The idea would be to develop a component that sits in front of salesforce. It authenticates the user using IRMA and then retrieves the correct identifier. Problem: which component will then compute the pseudonym? To do that, you would need the private key that can't be given to the user. I would say that the component that manages the authentiction with the user could also compute the pseudonym and send it to the user (using an encrypted connection).
NOTE: Salesofrce *does* have API access, but it also [depends on the edition]()(https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.242.0.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_rest_compatible_editions.htmi): "API access is available with Professional Edition, Performance Edition, Enterprise Edition, Unlimited Edition, and Developer Edition. For Professional
Edition, all requests for API access must be purchased and can be processed by contacting your Account Executive".
