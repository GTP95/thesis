- Is the [bureaucracy](https://irma.app/docs/issuer/) needed to become an IRMA issuer a problem? (Note that it's not needed for a demo application)
- For a demo application, to become an issuer it is required to also publish the *private* key, meaning that anyone could issue credentials with IDs for the test environment. Would this be a problem?
