\section{Supervisors}
This thesis project will be supervised by professor Bart Jacobs and professor Erik Poll.

\section{Expected timeframe}
This thesis project is expected to start in February 2023 and end in July 2023.

\section{Brief project description}
The goal of this thesis is to improve the PEP project\cite{pepproject}. PEP stands for Polymorphic Encryption and Pseudonymization and is a data repository designed to protect the privacy of the data owners while enabling them to disclose such data to third parties. It is an implementation of the tecniques described in the paper\cite{peppaper} and the protocol descibed in\cite{cryptoeprint}. The focus of this thesis will be the usage of PEP in the context of medical research. In particular, the first improvement will be designing and implementing a way for the partecipants in medical studies to get access to their own medical data after it has been stored inside a PEP repository. Such mechanism will use IRMA\cite{irma-app}\cite{about-irma} for the athentication phase. After this task is successfully carried out, further areas of improvement will be discussed with my supervisors.
