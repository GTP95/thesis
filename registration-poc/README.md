This is a [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) crate implementing PEP participant registration in the form of a web
application. It generates the needed credential. To run this, use
```Bash
$ cargo run
```
It is based on the [Rocket web framework](https://rocket.rs/) v0.5-rc. Before deploying, look at the available configuration
options [here](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/configuration/#configuration).
